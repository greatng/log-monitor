# Log monitor application

Build on node v20

How to run:

- run `npm ci` to install required package
- run `npm run start PATH_TO_FILENAME` to generate report for your file, eg `npm run start logs.log`

- run `npm run test` for run test script

Optional: Build a report

- run `npm run build:report` to generate report in `report.txt` file

Note:
- There are few test cases that need to be added, but I can't finish it in time.
